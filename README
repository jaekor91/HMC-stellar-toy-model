Image

Potential
- Notes: Various exploratory plots.
- Script used: one-star-potential.py
- Products:
	- one-star-V_dx.png: Plots of potential as a function of dx = (deviation in x direction from true x). Each panel corresponds to different true flux and dy.
	- one-star-V_m.png: Plots ofpotential as a function of model mag m. Each panel corresponds to different true m and shows plots of how the potential varies as a function of dr = dx.
	- one-star-V_dx_m.png: Plots of potential as a function of dx and model m. Each panel corresponds to different true flux and dy.
	- one-star-V_dx_dy.png: Plots of potential as a function of dx and dy. Each panel corresponds to different combination of true and model fluxes.

Gradients
- Notes: Gradient of the potential. Based on the images given in one-star-potential cases.
- Script used: one-star-grads.py
- Products:
	- one-star-dVdx_dx.png
	- one-star-dVdf_m.png
	- one-star-dVdx_dx_m.png
	- one-star-dVdf_dx_m.png: vmax=1. This way, we can see gradients turn positive vs. negative.

/---- One star in a no star background
General strategy:
- 48 x 48 image
- Place a star of a particular magnitude at the center and let it move. Find an appropriately fine scale time step for f, x, y.
- Use friction or max ceiling for veloctiy. RMS prop?
- Plot the trajectory in xy-space and xm-space. Use a color scheme to indicate time?
- Repeat for 1000 times for each choice of magnitude.
- After all of the above, try to see if it's possible to come up with a strategy to eliminate a star.
- Animation: Make an animation of how the trajectory unfolds...

One particle history with various initial magnitudes
- Notes: Follow the trajectory of a single particle including d_tx and so on.

/---- One star *mode* inference problem
General strategy:
- 48 x 48 image
- Place a star of a particular magnitude at 0-10 pixels away from the center and let it move. Find an appropriately fine scale time step for f, x, y.
- Use friction or max ceiling for veloctiy. RMS prop?
- Plot the trajectory in xy-space and xm-space. Use a color scheme to indicate time?
- Repeat for 1000 times for each choice of magnitude.
- Analyze the final modal distributions. Is the modal inference unbiased (i.e., average of the modes the same as truth)? What is the typical RMSE? What is the variance of the modal?
- How can you say about SN as a function magnitude?
- Come up with a strategy to eliminate escaping particles with a spatial prior. 
- Animation of how the particle approaches the mode of the potential.

/---- One star inference problem
General strategy:
- 48 x 48 image
- Place a star of a particular magnitude at 0-10 pixels away from the center and find the mode using strategy above (and eliminate particles if don't fit!)
- After mode has been found (how to assess this), starts performing HMC. Sample 10,000 points Construct a histogram. Show xm and xy scatter plots and histograms for first few. Plot mode and average; are they consistent with what you expect to see?
- Repeat for 1000 times for each choice of magnitude. Compile all histograms together (with a thin line for each).
- What can you say about SN as function of magnitude? What is the property of average as the estimator? What is the variance of the average estimator?
- How does the inference change as a function of background? PSF size?

Study problems of non-identifiability here.
Create informative diagonostic plots.
Store gradients.

/---- Two star *mode* inference problem
General strategy:
- 48 x 48 image
- Various combintaion of magnitude pairs (lower traingle)
- With and without repulsive potentials


/---- Repulsive potentials
Form: f_j * f_k * e^[-g(f_j * f_k) * r] [1/|x_j-x_k| + 1/|y_j-y_k|]



/---- Failed ideas
Post-hoc ordering of samples: 
A series of deterministic binary reduction mapping as a post-hoc. Recovers convergence statistics

/---- For later considerations
Use HD5
Look at the simulations to see if you can gain any insight!

Friction during burin-in
Blocking
Perhaps, the model could work by adding one star at a time and waiting until burn-in...
Repeat and see whether increasing number of stars can get accepted!
	- Study whether the number of stars can be determined this way... My guess is that once a star has fallen into its own well, it will stay there... Unless a fortuitous kicks to a parallel direction displaces one but not the other.
	- Empirical Bayes approach?
	- Stars can be randomly added... Only accept a star if... What criteria should be met?
Different parameterization to regularize gradient! Step in magnitude space and x/f, y/f
	Reparameterization doesn't reallly work!
Background can also be estimated :o 
Should be regularized... Hierarchical model? :o Spatial prior?
How do you approximate PSF?
C implementation
Admissibility -- All of stats?
When a new object is proposed, accept it only if it meets certain criteria
