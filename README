Potential
- Notes: Various exploratory plots.
- Script used: one-star-potential.py
- Products:
	- one-star-V_dx.png: Plots of potential as a function of dx = (deviation in x direction from true x). Each panel corresponds to different true flux and dy.
	- one-star-V_m.png: Plots ofpotential as a function of model mag m. Each panel corresponds to different true m and shows plots of how the potential varies as a function of dr = dx.
	- one-star-V_dx_m.png: Plots of potential as a function of dx and model m. Each panel corresponds to different true flux and dy.
	- one-star-V_dx_dy.png: Plots of potential as a function of dx and dy. Each panel corresponds to different combination of true and model fluxes.

Gradients
- dV(x)/dx at various y's including the correct one; f variation [15, 24]
- dV(x, f)/dx at various y's including the correct one
- V(x, y) at various f's
